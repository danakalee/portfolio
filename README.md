### Purpose
To showcase my understandng of HTML CSS And design theory.<br>
The portfolio should also express my personaility and professionalism to prospective employers. <br>

### Features
The webite is simple and repetitive but responsive. I wanted desktop users to be able to navigate away from the home page to see the images better.

### Target Audience 

Firstly the teachers marking the assignment and secondly prospective employers or collaborators. I was very weary of finding the balance between personality and professionalism.
<br> 
### Tech Stack 

HTML<br>
CSS - mostly flexbox <br>
Tiny wee bit of Jscript from a tutorial I did<br>
Currently my contact section doesn't work but I plan to look in to PHP in order to utilise the form.

## Design Documentation

### Process 
Initially I had a very simple website planned but reading the criteria revealed that this would not meet many of the requirements for the assignment. I decided early on to use Judit Just's weaving to create interest through texture. I knew that making my own original content would be too time consuming and I didnt want to spend too much time trolling through placeholder content for things that were relfective of my personalaity and appropriate for a portfolio. 
I found working with Judit's content very joyful and I hope to make a better portfolio of her work as a project on my website. 
In my original design inspired by <mattfarley.ca> I had planned to use only Pantone's 'Living Coral' colour of the year for 2019. 
### Wireframes

### Usability 

All images and links have the correct alt tags but when I ran the google chrome accessibilty audit I was unable to get a consistent score. My images are large but the lag to load time was not too bothersome for my taste. <br><br>

I tried to keep the content on the website as minimal as possible so screen readers would find it easy to use. Colour and mouse hover functions do not convey priority or any other important information that would be lost on the visually impared. <br>
