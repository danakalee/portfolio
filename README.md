### Purpose
To showcase my understandng of HTML CSS And design theory.<br>
The portfolio should also express my personaility and professionalism to prospective employers. <br>

### Features
The webite is simple and repetitive but responsive. I wanted desktop users to be able to navigate away from the home page to see the images better.

### Target Audience 

Firstly the teachers marking the assignment and secondly prospective employers or collaborators. I was very weary of finding the balance between personality and professionalism.
<br> 
### Tech Stack 

HTML<br>
CSS - mostly flexbox <br>
Tiny wee bit of Jscript from a tutorial I did<br>
Currently my contact section doesn't work but I plan to look in to PHP in order to utilise the form. 
## Design Documentation

### Process 
Initially I had a very simple website planned but reading the criteria revealed that this would not meet many of the requirements for the assignment. I decided early on to use Judit Just's weaving to create interest through texture. I knew that making my own original content would be too time consuming and I didnt want to spend too much time trolling through placeholdere content for things that were relfective of my personalaity and appropriate for a portfolio.
